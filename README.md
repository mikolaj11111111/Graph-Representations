# Graph Representations

## Description
Demonstrates three common graph representations:
1. **Adjacency Matrix** - 2D array representation
2. **Edge List** - List of all edges with weights
3. **Adjacency List** - Array of lists for each vertex

## Features
- Reads graph data from file "data.txt"
- Converts between different representations
- Displays all three formats
- Supports weighted graphs

## Usage
Requires "data.txt" with 8x8 adjacency matrix. Program converts and displays all three representations.
